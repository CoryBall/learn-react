# React Tutorial

## This branch shows examples of [DexExtreme](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/DevExtreme_React_Components/) React Components

The new page is `src/pages/devextreme.tsx`, and the component wrappers are in `src/components/devextreme`

I just copied some of the demos from their documentation, converting them to use Typescript and Functional Components

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
